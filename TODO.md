## Implementation Notes & Guidelines

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Development**: Work on pages one by one, complete each fully before moving to next
- **Admin Panel Focus**: Only update admin panel code, do not modify source HTML files
- **Consistency**: Maintain existing styling patterns and layout structure
- **Responsive Design**: Preserve mobile-first responsive design across all screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### Component Patterns
- **Page Structure**: Follow IndexPage.tsx pattern with tabbed interface
- **Image Management**: Use ImageInput for all image fields, integrate with gallery
- **Form Handling**: Use React Hook Form with comprehensive validation
- **State Management**: Local state for form data, Redux for navigation and global state
- **TypeScript**: Define proper interfaces for all content structures

### Code Organization
- **File Structure**: Place page editors in `src/pages/ContentEditor/`
- **Component Reuse**: Utilize existing base components from `src/components/Base/`
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes, follow dark mode patterns
- **Navigation**: Update `sideMenuSlice.ts` for new menu items

### Quality Assurance
- **Build Verification**: Run `npm run build` before marking tasks complete
- **Manual Testing**: Test all functionality, forms, validation, and responsive design
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Ensure no TypeScript errors or warnings
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions
