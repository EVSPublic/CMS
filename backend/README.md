# Admin Panel Backend - Clean Foundation

This backend project has been cleaned and prepared as a foundation for development.

## What's Included

- ✅ **Health Check API**: A single health endpoint at `/api/Health`
- ✅ **Swagger Documentation**: Available at `/swagger` in development
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Enabled for frontend development
- ✅ **Clean Project Structure**: Ready for new development

## What's Been Removed

- ❌ All business logic APIs (Auth, Users, Content, etc.)
- ❌ All Entity Framework models and migrations
- ❌ All service classes and DTOs
- ❌ All database tables (cleaned from MySQL)
- ❌ JWT authentication configuration and dependencies
- ❌ Database context and seeding
- ❌ All package dependencies except Swagger

## Health Endpoint

The health endpoint provides basic API status information:

```
GET /api/Health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "Healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "Development"
}
```

## Running the Backend

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at:
- HTTP: http://localhost:5050
- Swagger: http://localhost:5050/swagger

## Next Steps for Development

Refer to the `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` file in the admin_panel directory for:
- Database schema requirements
- API endpoints to implement
- Authentication setup
- File upload configuration
- Integration requirements

## Project Structure

```
/Controllers/
  WeatherForecastController.cs  # Health endpoint (renamed)
/Models/                        # Empty - ready for new models
/Services/                      # Empty - ready for new services
/DTOs/                          # Empty - ready for new DTOs
/Data/                          # Empty - ready for DbContext
/Migrations/                    # Empty - ready for new migrations

This clean foundation is ready for implementing the full admin panel API according to the specifications in the integration guide.
